Cryptography and Network Security Lab Assignments
This repository contains six Python practical assignments for the Cryptography and Network Security lab. The programs demonstrate encryption, decryption, key exchange, hashing, digital signatures, and secure image transmission.

Requirements
Python 3.x
cryptography Python package
Install the required package
pip install cryptography
Note: Assignments 2 and 4 use Python's built-in modules and do not require the cryptography package. Assignments 1, 3, 5, and 6 use the cryptography package.

Assignments
1. RSA Performance Analysis
Implements RSA encryption and decryption using the OAEP padding scheme.
Measures key generation, encryption, and decryption time.
Compares performance for different RSA key sizes and message sizes.
Uses the cryptography package.
2. XOR Encryption and Decryption
Demonstrates a basic symmetric encryption technique using XOR.
Uses the same secret key for encryption and decryption.
Shows how applying XOR with the same key twice restores the original message.
Uses Python's built-in functions; no external package required.
3. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange with Man-in-the-Middle Attack
Demonstrates the Diffie-Hellman key exchange algorithm.
Simulates Alice, Bob, and an attacker (Eve).
Shows how an attacker can intercept and replace public keys to establish separate shared secrets with both parties.
Uses the cryptography package only if your implementation imports it; the basic modular-arithmetic demonstration can run with Python's built-in functions.
4. SHA-1 Hashing and Avalanche Effect
Generates a SHA-1 message digest.
Modifies the original message and calculates its hash again.
Demonstrates the avalanche effect, where a small input change produces a significantly different hash.
Uses Python's built-in hashlib module; no external package required.
5. Digital Signature using DSS/DSA
Generates a DSA private and public key pair.
Creates a digital signature using the private key and SHA-256.
Verifies the signature using the public key.
Demonstrates message integrity and signature authentication.
Uses the cryptography package.
6. Secure Image Transmission using Fernet
Reads an image in binary mode.
Encrypts the image using Fernet symmetric encryption.
Saves the encrypted data and decrypts it.
Reconstructs the original image from the decrypted data.
Uses the cryptography package.
Input file required: image.jpg must be present in the same directory as the Python script.

Running the Programs
Navigate to the relevant assignment directory and run:

python filename.py
For example:

python rsa_performance.py
Important Notes
These programs are educational demonstrations of cryptographic concepts.
The XOR implementation uses a fixed key and is not secure for real-world use.
The Diffie-Hellman MITM demonstration uses small sample parameters for learning; real systems require secure parameters and authenticated key exchange.
SHA-1 is included for learning purposes. It is not recommended for modern security-sensitive applications because of known collision weaknesses. Prefer SHA-256 or stronger.
The RSA experiment includes a 1024-bit key size for comparison; use at least 2048-bit RSA keys for modern applications.
The Fernet program generates a key at runtime. For actual communication, the receiver must securely obtain the same key.
